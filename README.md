# sim-project
This is a C++ simulation project I did for an OOP course. Developed using MS Visual Studio 2013 Pro.
The project uses object oriented design principles. It includes classes that implement the singleton 
pattern, modified factory pattern and a builder/prototype pattern that I called helper classes before
we were fully introduced to the GoF patterns in lecture.
